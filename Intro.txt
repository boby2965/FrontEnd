Network:
--------
    - A network is made up of atleast two devices that are connected and communicate via wired or wireless connection.
    - A network switch can connect to another switch to link two networks.
    - Such multiple switches are connected to form an Interconnected network like the "Internet".

Server:
-------
    - A server is a computer that runs applications and services ranging from websites to instant messaging. 
    - It's called a server because it provides a service to another computer and its user also known as the client. 
    - Is typically stored in something called a data center with hundreds or thousands of other servers, all running 
    different services connected to the internet.

Webserver:
----------
    - A web server is a computer that runs websites. It's a computer program that distributes web pages as they are requisitioned. 
    - The basic objective of the web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to the users. 
    - A web server has many functions which includes website storage and administration, data storage, security and managing email.
    - Another primary function is to handle something known as a web request. 
    - When you open a browser on your device and type the name of the website, it's the job of the web server to send 
    you back to that website's content. 
    - This process is known as the request response cycle and you will learn more about it later. 
    - Web servers are also designed to respond to thousands of requests from clients per second.
    - This intercommunication is done using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

HTTP Status Codes
-----------------
The first digit of an HTTP status code indicates the category of the response: from (100 to 599)
Information(1xx), Successful(2xx), Redirection(3xx), Client Error(4xx) or Server Error(5xx).

The common status codes you'll encounter for each category are:

    1XX Informational
    -----------------
    Status Code             Reason Phrase               Description
    -----------             -------------               -----------
    100                     Continue                    The server received the request headers and should continue to send the request body.
    101                     Switching Protocols         The client has requested the server to switch protocols and the server has agreed to do so.

    2XX Successful
    -------------
    Status Code             Reason Phrase               Description

    200                     OK                          Standard response returned by the server to indicate it successfully processed the request.
    201                     Created                     The server successfully processed the request and a resource was created.
    202                     Accepted                    The server accepted the request for processing but the processing has not yet been completed.
    204                     No Content                  The server successfully processed the request but is not returning any content.

    3XX Redirection
    ---------------
    Status Code             Reason Phrase               Description
    -----------             -------------               -----------
    301                     Moved Permanently           This request and all future requests should be sent to the returned location.
    302                     Found                       This request should be sent to the returned location.
    
    4XX Client Error

    ------------            -------------               -----------uyitryuytretyurieetryueeetryutreyuteruyiertyuiy
    400                     Bad Request                 The server cannot process the request due to a client error, e.g., invalid request or transmitted data is too large.
    401                     Unauthorized                The client making the request is unauthorized and should authenticate.
    403                     Forbidden                   The request was valid but the server is refusing to process it. This is usually returned due to the client having insufficient permissions for the website, e.g., requesting an administrator action but the user is not an administrator.
    404                     Not Found                   The server did not find the requested resource.

    502                     Bad Gateway                 The web server received an invalid response from the Application Server.
    503                     Service Unavailable         The web server cannot process the request.

HTTP:
----
Hypertext Transfer Protocols (HTTP) are used on top of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to transfer webpages 
and other content from websites.

This reading explores other protocols commonly used on the Internet.

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):
-------------------------------------------
Your computer communicates over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) using the protocol with a type of server called a DHCP server. 
The server keeps track of computers on the network and their IP addresses. It will assign your computer an IP address and 
respond over the protocol to let it know which IP address to use. Once your computer has an IP address, it can communicate 
with other computers on the network. You've learned that computers need IP addresses to communicate with each other. When 
your computer connects to a network, the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol or DHCP as it is commonly known, 
is used to assign your computer an IP address.

Domain Name System Protocol (DNS):
----------------------------------
Your computer needs a way to know with which IP address to communicate when you visit a website in your web browser, 
for example, meta.com. The Domain Name System Protocol, commonly known as DNS, provides this function. Your computer 
then checks with the DNS server associated with the domain name and then returns the correct IP address.

Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP):
----------------------------------------
Do you check your emails on your mobile or tablet device? Or maybe you use an email application on your computer? 
Your device needs a way to download emails and manage your mailbox on the server storing your emails. This is the purpose 
of the Internet Message Access Protocol or IMAP.

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP):
-------------------------------------
Now that your emails are on your device, you need a way to send emails. The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, or SMTP,
is used. It allows email clients to submit emails for sending via an SMTP server. You can also use it to receive emails 
from an email client, but IMAP is more commonly used.

Post Office Protocol (POP):
---------------------------
The Post Office Protocol (POP) is an older protocol used to download emails to an email client. The main difference 
in using POP instead of IMAP is that POP will delete the emails on the server once they have been downloaded to your 
local device. Although it is no longer commonly used in email clients, developers often use it to implement email 
automation as it is a more straightforward protocol than IMAP.

File Transfer Protocol (FTP):
-----------------------------
When running your websites and web applications on the Internet, you'll need a way to transfer the files from your 
local computer to the server they'll run on. The standard protocol used for this is the File Transfer Protocol or FTP.
FTP allows you to list, send, receive and delete files on a server. Your server must run an FTP Server and you will need an 
FTP Client on your local machine. You'll learn more about these in a later course.

Secure Shell Protocol (SSH):
----------------------------
When you start working with servers, you'll also need a way to log in and interact with the computer remotely. The most 
common method of doing this is using the Secure Shell Protocol, commonly referred to as SSH. Using an SSH client allows 
you to connect to an SSH server running on a server to perform commands on the remote computer.
All data sent over SSH is encrypted. This means that third parties cannot understand the data transmitted.
Only the sending and receiving computers can understand the data.

SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP):
----------------------------------
The data is transmitted insecurely when using the File Transfer Protocol. This means that third parties may 
understand the data that you are sending. This is not right if you transmit company files such as software and 
databases. To solve this, the SSH File Transfer Protocol, alternatively called the Secure File Transfer Protocol, 
can be used to transfer files over the SSH protocol. This ensures that the data is transmitted securely. Most 
FTP clients also support the SFTP protocol.
