        <p>Your computer communicates over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) using the protocol with a type of server called a DHCP server. 
            The server keeps track of computers on the network and their IP addresses. It will assign your computer an IP address and 
            respond over the protocol to let it know which IP address to use. Once your computer has an IP address, it can communicate 
            with other computers on the network. You've learned that computers need IP addresses to communicate with each other. When 
            your computer connects to a network, the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol or DHCP as it is commonly known, 
            is used to assign your computer an IP address.
